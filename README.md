#### To make ease of communication b/w medical representative and managers of pharma company we choosen this project. so that using single software they seemingly do communnication.

## Technologies Used:

- Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for Desktop Application
- MSSQL Server 2016 for Database.

## Main features

- Manager can assign localities to Medical Representative.
- medical representative has to create tour program for week and need to get approved by region manager so we created form for that in which medical representative fill the details and upload; Other side manager can
  review it also edit if he want after it get approved.
- medical representative has to visit in their region's differnet cities and need to visit doctor of that city. so they need to record which doctor they visited and in which medicine they are interested. that Report kinda forms are filled by medical representative and need to send manager.
- Admin can add new medicine and also edit and remove medicine Deleted.
